# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Sentiment analysis of customer feedbacks via natural language processing.

In our project we used three machine learning models (SVM, KNN, and SVMPCA) to perform sentiment analysis on the restaurant review dataset. The SVM 
and SVM-PCA model has the highest accuracy of 94% in classifying the reviews 
as positive and negative whereas, the KNN model gave us an accuracy of 90%. We 
used a bag-of-words model for representing text data for modeling text with 
machine learning algorithms. The bag-of-words model is simple to understand and 
implement and has seen great success in problems such as language modeling and 
document classification
